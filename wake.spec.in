%description
Wake is a build orchestration tool and language.
If you have a build whose steps cannot be adequately expressed in
make/tup/bazel/etc, you probably need wake.
If you don't want to waste time rebuilding things that don't need it,
or that your colleagues already built, you might appreciate wake.
