License: CC0
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
 confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
 creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
 original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work")
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate
 in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
 form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
 commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to
 promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
 creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
 greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may
    be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
    ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
    include, but are not limited to, the following:
 .
    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
       communicate, and translate a Work;
    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
       performer(s);
    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image
       or likeness depicted in a Work;
    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
       Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
       reuse of data in a Work;
    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive
       96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
       11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and
       under any national implementation thereof, including any
       amended or successor version of such directive); and
    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout
       the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
       implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
    contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
    permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
    and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
    and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
    unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes
    of action), in the Work
 .
    (i)   in all territories worldwide,
    (ii)  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
          treaty (including future time extensions),
    (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
          copies, and
    (iv)  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
          commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
          "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of
          each member of the public at large and to the detriment
          of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
          such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission,
          cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable
          action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
          public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of
          Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
    law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
    permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
    Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
    Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
    non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
    and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
    Related Rights in the Work
 .
    (i)   in all territories worldwide,
    (ii)  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
          treaty (including future time extensions),
    (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
          copies, and
    (iv)  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
          commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
          "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of
          the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should
          any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
          invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
          invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the
          remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
          hereby affirms that he or she will not
 .
          (i)  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and
               Related Rights in the Work or
          (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
               with respect to the Work, in either case contrary
               to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
       abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by
       this document.
    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations
       or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express,
       implied, statutory or otherwise, including without
       limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
       for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence
       of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the
       greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
       other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
       including without limitation any person's Copyright and
       Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
       responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
       permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons
       is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation
       with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
